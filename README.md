# Omega-File-Tree
I created a file-system suited to my hobbyist and professional needs. There's always a danger with trees like this of abstracting your files so much that navigating folders becomes far more painful than it needs to be. I tried my best to keep this somewhat concise but 100% organized using terms and structures that I personally find easy to navigate. You're free to adapt this however you want. The "files" you may find inside this are all empty. I just renamed file extensions for the purpose of creating examples.

Some of you may find that certain files, folders, and such are missing here. Whenever you make a tree of your own, don't bother keeping a bunch of folders that you won't be using. It just adds to the complexity for no real reason. 

Be realistic. What files do you actually like to keep? What can you actually keep organized? Then move on from there. Hope this tree works well for you.
